    According to HTTP Archive, <a href="http://httparchive.org/trends.php?s=All&minlabel=Feb+15+2013&maxlabel=Feb+15+2015#perFonts">~50% of top 300K sites</a> are using web fonts as of early 2015, which translates to a 3x+ increase over the past two years. Typography has always been an important part of good design, branding, and readability and web fonts offer many additional benefits. However fonts are an additional critical resource on the page, they can impact rendering speed of our pages.

    You can really feel the fonts loading slowly on the web:

    Fonts are an additional critical resource on the page, it rely browser rendering API which work with OS font rendering system. Browsers has different implementation of font rendering behaviours:
<ul>
    <li>
        IE immediately renders text with the fallback font and re-renders it once the font download is complete.
    </li>
    <li>
        Chrome and Safari hold font rendering until the font download is complete.
    </li>
    <li>
        Firefox holds font rendering for up to 3 seconds, after which it uses a fallback font, and once the font download has finished it re-renders the text once more with the downloaded font.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="progressive-render">Progressive Render</h2>
<p>
    With best effort, there are <a href="http://caniuse.com/#feat=fontface">93% of browsers</a> support web fonts today. Font may also not rendered due to network timeout. And give IE render with fallback fonts at first place, the best would to accept the page could be rendered without custom font.
</p>
<p>
    When page speed is important such as at landing pages, we could render the page without font first. Then progressive render the customer fonts on page load. Subsequent pages with same font reference will be rendered immediately once it's been cached.

    <script>
        (function () {
            var href = '//full-url-to-css-with-font-as-data-url';
            var loadCss=function(){
                var ss = document.createElement("link");
                ss.rel = "stylesheet";
                ss.href = href;
                var ref = document.getElementsByTagName("script")[ 0 ];
                ref.parentNode.insertBefore(ss, ref);
            }

            try{
                var cacheKey='sio-loaded-'+href
                if(localStorage[cacheKey]){
                    loadCss();
                }else{
                    localStorage[cacheKey]=Date.now();
                    window.addEventListener('load', function(){
                        loadCss();
                    }, false);
                }
            }catch(ignore){
                loadCss();
